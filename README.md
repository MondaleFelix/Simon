### Description 
---
This is a web based gamed of Simon. Simon is a memory game that functions
by giving the user a pattern that needs to be repeated. It excersizes three
of the five senses which allows the user to develop techniques to advance 
further into the game.
### Instructions
---
Start by selecting the level of difficulty. In this game of Simon, increasing 
the difficulty makes it exponentially harder. Each increase makes the pattern 
larger. Once you have selected your difficulty, play by clicking the middle button.
Score is increased based on difficulty, which means the harder the game, the more points you recieve. If you fail to repeat the given pattern, you lose. You can also
lose by not having fun! So challenge your friends and enjoy exercising your
memory.

### Technologies Used
---
This game of Simon uses evolving technologies; HTML, CSS, jQuery, 
Javascript, and Git. 

### Bugs
---
1) If the user interupts the button changing process (the button changing
from clicked to unclicked), the pattern will increasingly get faster.

2) In the middle of a game, the pattern can be shown again if you press the
middle button. This ultimately defeats the purpose of being a memory game.

3) If you click a colored button prior to the middle button, it will set 
set off the lose function. 
### Future Updates
---
1) A mute button because I made the mistake of wearing earphones while testing
the game.
